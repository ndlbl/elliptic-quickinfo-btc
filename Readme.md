## Elliptic Quick Info

Run a quick scan on a bitcoin address and receive back balance and XCP asset information.

```
$ node index.js %ADDRESS%

```


some example address to run might be:

* 1GQhaWqejcGJ4GhQar7SjcCfadxvf5DNBD   early artist
* 1Q5RMGBu65zURuVvGMuF57BkW1Z7KyvLMH   big collector
* 1J8aLankHbmAHojseGRmWRZoTZKiNVi5GQ  random XCP user
* 1NwCmg8gZW7KykrA7mX16zugNZZuckPg5o random XCP user

Seems to suffer from rate limiting from blockcypher.
